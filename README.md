# AdvertisingPredictiveModeling

This project uses the CTR In Advertisement public dataset [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/ctr-in-advertisement) to predict whether a user will click on a digital advertisement. Leveraging rich user, product, and campaign features, the workflow covers data cleaning, categorical encoding, feature scaling, and model training within a reproducible Jupyter notebook. Multiple classification algorithms are explored, starting from interpretable baselines such as Logistic Regression and progressing to ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest) to capture non‑linear relationships in click behavior. Model performance is evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1‑score to address class imbalance and quantify real-world utility in ad targeting scenarios. The repository is structured to provide a practical foundation for production‑grade ad click‑through prediction systems.
